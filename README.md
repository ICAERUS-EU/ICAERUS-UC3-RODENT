# ICAERUS-RODENT
Repo for Rodent Obstruction through Drone-Enabled Non-invasive Technology project.

## Structure
This repository contains:
- testing_SPL/
    - rezultati_merenja.m loads measured signals from signali/ with filenames of the form elevacija_x.mat where x ranges from 1 to 30. These signals were recorded on the surface beneath the parabola to assess sound-field coverage. The script computes the sound pressure level (SPL) on the surface located 1.0 m below the parabola's center, for a parabola of radius 0.58 m, and summarises the spatial SPL distribution used for coverage analysis. The signali/ dataset is hosted on the Zenodo platform (add your Zenodo DOI/URL here).
